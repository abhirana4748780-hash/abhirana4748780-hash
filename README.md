# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhinav

Data Scientist | Python | Machine Learning | SQL | C | C++ | Java | Web Development  

I focus on building **practical, explainable solutions** using data and code — not just running notebooks.
Currently strengthening fundamentals in **Python, Advanced Python, Machine Learning**, along with strong programming foundations across multiple languages.

## 📂 Projects
This repository includes:
- Python fundamentals & advanced concepts
- Data analysis notebooks
- Machine Learning projects with real datasets
- End-to-end workflows (EDA → Modeling → Evaluation)
- Clean, readable, well-structured code

Each project emphasizes **why a model is chosen**, not just how it’s implemented.

## 📈 Learning Philosophy
- Understand the problem before the model
- Start simple, then improve
- Write code that is readable and maintainable
- Learn by building, not copying
